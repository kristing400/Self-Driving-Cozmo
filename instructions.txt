Unzip the dir and move it into the handin dir at the same level as the code.
DrivePics.fsm: genfsm and run this code normally through simple_cli
               This code will let you drive the cozmo manually as it takes
               pictures and labels them with steering angles. Hold down the
               "w" button do let the cozmo move forward. Use the mouse to 
               steer the robot on the camera image (the more right the 
               mouse is from the center, the more it will turn right and 
               vice versa).
RunCNN.fsm: genfsm and run this code normally through simple_cli
            This code will run the robot with the given model. Press
            "w" to start the robot once it has restored its Tensorflow
            session, and press "w" to stop the robot. 
cnn.py: This code will train the neural net given a dir of training images.
        run "python2 cnn.py" to train the nerual net, make sure the 
        training images directory is set to the desired location. Sorry
        we ran the script in python2 on our AWS instance.
run.py: This program will stitch and generate images from the first 
        convolutional layer. Run "python2 run.py <path to image> <path to Tensorflow checkpoint>"
        to generate a stiched image of weights learned from first 
        convolutional layer.
